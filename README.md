# simple-electricity-bill-tracker
A program written in C lang to keep track of the electricity bill of a house.

The program keeps track of the electricity bill of a house with the following features.

When the program is executing for the first time, it asks for the last month's meter reading and the bill amount.
The program would then display the last metre reading and the bill amount, below it the program would display the main menu as follows,
        [1]. Enter this month's reading
        [2]. Enter payment details
        [3]. View payment history
        [4]. View monthly power consumption 

The program maintains a text file with three colums; Month number, meter reading, payment;
Situation 1 - when the meter reading is updated (month =1, reading=251244, payment=0) the new row looks like
3    251244    0
Situation 2- when a payment of 500 is made 
3    0    -500
